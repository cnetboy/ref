The upgrade branch was created to support image creation for VMs with completly virtual networks which also have floating IPs
The earlier version catered for direct connection of VMs to external networks, through the medium of VLANs on an external network interface
This code has some dependencies on OpenStack patch levels - this is only applicable in the case that the user wants to have floating IPs created automatically.  The OpenStack bug report which describes this is here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70286/22/.  I created a patch file in this directory, which can be applied directly to a Juno release. (patch.floatingip)
